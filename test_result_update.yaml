        comment: "✅ FIXED 422 ERROR ON SAVE: The backend validation was failing because 'transition' field in AlbumSlide model was restricted to a strict Enum (SlideTransition) which didn't include the new 'imagination-*' animation strings. I relaxed the model to accept any 'str' for the transition field, allowing all 71+ new animations to be saved correctly. Restarted backend to apply changes."
