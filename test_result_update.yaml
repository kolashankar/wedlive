        comment: "✅ REDESIGNED EDITOR UI: 1) Created 'AnimationRibbon' component with Excel-style horizontal scrolling grid (2 rows) for animations, categorized tabs (Entrance/Exit/Transitions/Effects), and controls for Duration/Music/ApplyAll. 2) Created 'SlideSidebar' component for vertical media list with thumbnails and active animation badges. 3) Refactored 'AlbumDetail.js' to use a professional 3-pane layout (Sidebar-Canvas-Ribbon). 4) Updated 'SlideshowPlayer.js' to support 'embedded' mode and 'controlledIndex', ensuring instant live preview on the editor canvas. 5) Implemented key-based re-mounting in SlideshowPlayer to trigger transition animations instantly when selected in the Ribbon."
