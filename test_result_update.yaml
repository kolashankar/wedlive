        comment: "✅ FIXED ANIMATION OVERLAY RENDERING: 1) Refactored SlideshowPlayer.js to use a shrink-wrapped container logic. The overlay now stays strictly within the media element bounds, matching the image size exactly. 2) Removed global full-screen overlay that was causing blur/darkening of the entire screen. 3) Scoped the 'Imagination' GIF overlay to the image container using mix-blend-mode: multiply inside the scoped wrapper. 4) Added auto-fade-out animation for the overlay so it disappears after the transition duration. 5) Ensured 'max-w' and 'max-h' constraints are used to preserve aspect ratio without letterboxing artifacts affecting the overlay."
