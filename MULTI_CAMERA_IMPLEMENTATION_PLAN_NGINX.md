## 🎬 Multi-Camera Live Streaming - Implementation Plan (NGINX-RTMP)

### ✅ Current State Analysis
You Already Have:
- ✅ NGINX-RTMP Server - Custom streaming engine (Port 1935 RTMP, Port 8080 HLS)
- ✅ RTMP Webhooks - on-publish, on-publish-done, on-update
- ✅ Stream Service - Generates stream keys, manages credentials
- ✅ Recording Service - FFmpeg-based recording
- ✅ Multi-Camera API Endpoints - Add/Remove camera (Premium only)
- ✅ Live Status Service - State management (waiting → live → paused → ended)
- ✅ Wedding Management - Complete CRUD operations
- ✅ MongoDB - Data persistence
- ✅ React Frontend - Wedding management UI

### 🏗️ Architecture (NGINX-RTMP Based)

CAMERAS (OBS) → NGINX-RTMP (Port 1935) → HLS Chunks (Port 8080)
                       ↓
                  Webhooks notify FastAPI
                       ↓
                FFmpeg Composition Service
                       ↓
              Output HLS → Viewers (HLS.js)
